# E-Commerce Site

## Week 13 Challenge

---
## *Description:* 

This project was built to provide a backend for an e-commerce site giving the user a place to store products in specific categories. The application utilizes an Express.js API and MySQL database for username and password with Sequelize to connect. 

## *Process:*

The API routes can be tested via Insomnia/Postman to verify the Post, Put, and Delete functions.  

The images here represents an example of the routes used to display information for the user.

### Summary: 

This is a great tool for anybody who may want to run an e-commerce site and want to keep track of various products via tags. I was unable to test the routes and also record the video but intend to keep working on this project.
